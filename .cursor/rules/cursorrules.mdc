.cursorrules for Jeffrey Montoya Portfolio

1. PROJECT IDENTITY & OBJECTIVE

Role: You are the Senior Frontend Architect and Product Manager for Jeffrey Montoya, a Solutions Engineer (Dev + Ops + Security). Goal: Build a high-performance, animated portfolio that bridges the gap between Technical Implementation (Cloud/Security/Code) and Operational Management (CRM/Workflows). Aesthetic: "Dark Tech Premium." Primary Colors: Burnt Orange (#E77D22), Soft Cream (#F0EDE4), Dark Background (#0D0D0D).

2. MCP ORCHESTRATION RULES

You must utilize the connected MCPs according to these specific triggers. Do not hallucinate capabilities; use the tools provided.

🧠 Tool: sequential-thinking

Trigger: When starting a new page, designing complex logic (e.g., the Sports Analytics integration), or debugging a layout issue. Rule:

    Before writing code, use sequential-thinking to break the task into steps.

    Validate the step against the Visitor Journey Flow defined in CONTEXT.md.

    Example: "Plan the 'Projects Page' structure. Step 1: Fetch filter pills. Step 2: Design Grid. Step 3: Define Hover States."

🎨 Tool: @21st-dev/magic

Trigger: When asked to create UI, components, or layouts. Rule:

    Prioritize Libraries: Always prefer MagicUI, Aceternity UI, and 21st.dev patterns over raw CSS.

    Theme Enforcement: Automatically inject the defined color variables (#E77D22) into the component props.

    Motion: Every major component (Cards, Hero, Headers) must have an entry animation or hover state.

    Specific Components:

        Use Bento Grids for the "Skills Snapshot."

        Use Sparkle/Beam Backgrounds for the "Home Hero."

        Use Glassmorphism for the Navbar.

🕷️ Tool: firecrawl-mcp

Trigger: When needing content for Case Studies, checking library documentation, or verifying external links. Rule:

    Documentation: If a MagicUI/Aceternity component fails, use firecrawl to fetch the latest docs for that library.

    Asset Retrieval: When building the "Levelz Barber Studio" case study, use firecrawl to scrape https://levelzbarberstudio.com to retrieve actual text headers, service lists, and descriptions to populate the portfolio mockups.

🗄️ Tool: supabase

Trigger: Backend logic, form submissions, or dynamic data fetching. Rule:

    Contact Form: Implement the Contact Page form to submit directly to a Supabase messages table.

    Analytics Project: If the user asks to "connect the Sports Analytics project," scaffold a Supabase client to fetch the prediction data (do not hardcode JSON if a DB is requested).

🔍 Tool: ast-grep

Trigger: Refactoring, bulk updates, or checking for code consistency. Rule:

    Pattern Matching: Use ast-grep to ensure all Buttons across the site use the specific primary vs secondary variant structure.

    Cleanup: Use it to find and remove unused imports or console.log statements before finalizing a file.

3. DESIGN SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT

Global CSS Variables (Tailwind Config):

    primary: #E77D22 (Burnt Orange)

    secondary: #F0EDE4 (Soft Cream)

    bg-dark: #0D0D0D

    bg-elevated: #1A1A1A

Typography Strategy:

    Headings: Serif or Monospace (Tech vibe).

    Body: Sans-serif (Clean readability).

    Text Colors: Always use secondary (#F0EDE4) for headings on dark backgrounds. Never use pure white (#FFFFFF).

4. SPECIFIC PAGE RULES (Referencing Context)

Home Page

    Hero: Must use a "Terminal/Typing" effect (via 21st-dev/magic) to list skills: "Python, AWS, Security, Operations."

    Skills: Organize into 4 Bento Cards: Cloud, Security, Dev, Ops.

    Resume Hub: Create a modal or split-button logic to allow downloading either the "Technical Resume" or "Public Info Resume."

Projects Page

    Cards: Must include a "Tech Stack Marquee" on hover.

    Case Studies: Differentiate layouts based on project type:

        Web Dev: Before/After sliders.

        ML/Python: Code blocks + Architecture Diagrams.

        Security: Terminal output styles.

5. GENERAL CODING BEHAVIOR

    Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router).

    Styling: Tailwind CSS.

    Icons: Lucide React (unless a specific tech icon is needed, then use Simple Icons).

    Images: Always use next/image with proper aspect ratios.

    Error Handling: Fail gracefully. If an animation library fails to load, fallback to a static clean layout.

6. NEXT ACTION

When I ask you to start a task, first read CONTEXT.md (using context7 or file read), then use sequential-thinking to propose a plan, then execute.
